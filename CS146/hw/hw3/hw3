3.1

Inserting the following input into hash tables of size 10:
{4371, 1323, 6173, 4199, 4344, 9679, 1989}

a. Separate Chaining

    0:
    1: 4371 ->
    2:
    3: 1323 -> 6173 ->
    4: 4344 ->
    5:
    6:
    7:
    8:
    9: 4199 -> 9679 -> 1989 ->

b. Linear Probing

    0: 9679
    1: 4371
    2: 1989
    3: 1323
    4: 6173
    5: 4344
    6:
    7:
    8:
    9: 4199

c. Quadratic Probing

    f(i) = i^2

    0: 4371
    1: 1989
    2:
    3: 1323
    4: 6173
    5: 4344
    6:
    7:
    8: 9679
    9: 4199

d. Double Hashing

    H1(x) = x mod 10
    H2(x) = 7 âˆ’ (x mod 7)

    0: 1323
    1: 4371
    2:
    3: 1323
    4:
    5:
    6:
    7:
    8:
    9:


3.2

Rehashing 3.1 tables to size of next prime, 23, all result in the same table since there's no collisions.

3.3

Separate Chaining Hashing
    Advantage
        - Collided elements do not occupy another location in the hash table
        - Another element can always be added
    Disadvantage
        - Some hash indexes may become essentially a linked list, defeating the purpose by diminishing performance

Linear Probing
    Advantage
        - Solves the disadvantage of separate chaining, maintains
        - Available index can always be found if there's room in the table.
    Disadvantage
        - Does not prevent blocks of indexes in the table from being occupied, resulting in primary clustering
