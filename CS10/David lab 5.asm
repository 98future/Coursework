# Lab response:
# Performance between blocked and unblocked multiply were exactly the same for me.
# I set the placement policy as direct mapping and cache block size to 64 words,
# and then tried N-way set associative with a set size of 2. Both multiplication
# algorithms resulted in 1920 hits and 4 misses. Even when changing the block size
# to 128, 256, or 512, the hit and miss count were exactly the same.

# Terms:
# m - matrix
# r - row

# $t5 - matrix to print, current position in a matrix (getMatrix and printMatrix)
# $t6 - counter fro getMatrix
# $t7 - 1st counter for inner loop (printMatrix, getMatrix)
# $t8 - 2nd counter for outer loop (printMatrix, getMatrix)
# $t9 - Data position in matrix
# $t0-t4 - used by matrix multiply

# $t6-t7 - block mult offsets, t6 being 'vertical' and t7 being 'horizontal'
# $t8 - 1st matrix to multiply (block mult)
# $t9 - 2nd matrix to multiply (block mult)

# $s0 - Reserved for matrix multiply
# $s1 - Reserved for matrix multiply
# $s2 - Reserved for matrix multiply

# $s4 - dimension of matrix (8)
# $s5 - start of m1
# $s6 - start of m2
# $s7 - start of m3 (results)
